      <description>Chapter 1 - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)1.1 - Recognizing a road sign with kNNAfter several trips with a human behind the wheel, it is time for the self-driving car to attempt the test course alone.
As it begins to drive away, its camera captures the following image:
Figure 1: A captionCan you apply a kNN classifier to help the car recognize this sign?
The dataset signs must be loaded in your workspace along with the dataframe next_sign, which holds the observation you want to classify.</description>
