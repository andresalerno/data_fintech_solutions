      <description>ObjectiveOur goal here is to create a R Model and put-in into production by deploying it as web service API using Docker to containerize (encapsulate) it and Microsoft Azure to host it.
R ModelTo create the model, we going to use mtcars dataset which oneâ€™s is present inside R.

      <description>ObjectiveOur goal is to train a Neural Network to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in a dataset referring to two days transactions by european cardholders.
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data
Datacredit = read.csv(path)The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days.
As we can see, this dataset consists of thirty explanatory variables, and a response variable which represents whether a transation was a fraud or not.</description>

      <description>R Packages for RegressionFor this post we will present some valuable R packages for using in regression studies. Check it out!
statsPackage very useful for statistical calculations and random number generations.
Below you can find the most useful function in regression area:
lm(): it is used to fit linear models
summary.lm(): thsi function returns a summary for linear model fits
coef(): it is possible obtain the coefficients from modeling functions</description>

      <description>Random ForestIn this post we will explore some ideas around the Random Forest model
ObjectiveWe are working on in the dataset called Boston Housing and the main idea here is regression task and we are concerned with modeling the price of houses in thousands of dollars in the Surburb of Boston.
So, we are dirting our hands in a regression predictive modeling problem.
The main goal here is to fit a regression model that best explains the variation in medv variable.</description>
