text: "Andre was one of the most enthusiatic, motivaded and dedicated student of our Master Classes at FGV which occured during 2012-2014. Andre always strived to go deep in every discussion that we have had and share his relavant professional and academic experiencies with the other colleagues of our class. Besides that, Andre, was also committed with the quality of our classes; he was, on a voluntary basis, our class representative and certainly met the expectation of all the other students. I learned a lot with Andre and I am sure all the other colleagues did so. I really appreciate the fact that Andre could participate in most of my groups during our classes."
