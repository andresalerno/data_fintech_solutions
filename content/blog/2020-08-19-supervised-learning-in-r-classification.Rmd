# Chapter 1 - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

## 1.1 - Recognizing a road sign with kNN

After several trips with a human behind the wheel, it is time for the self-driving car to attempt the test course alone.

As it begins to drive away, its camera captures the following image:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/data_fintech_solutions/temp.png")
```

Can you apply a kNN classifier to help the car recognize this sign?

The dataset `signs` must be loaded in your workspace along with the dataframe next_sign, which holds the observation you want to classify.


```{r}

library(class)

signs <- read.csv(file = "/data_fintech_solutions/knn_traffic_signs.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

dim(signs)

names(signs)

```



```{r}
# get the number of observations
n_obs <- nrow(signs)

# Shuffle row indices: permuted_rows
permuted_rows <- sample(n_obs)

# Randomly order data: signs_shuffled
signs_shuffled <- signs[permuted_rows, ]

# Identify row to split on: split
split <- round(n_obs * 0.7)

# Create train
train <- signs_shuffled[1:split, 3:51]

# Create test
test <- signs_shuffled[(split + 1):n_obs, 3:51]

# Create a vector of labels
sign_types <- signs_shuffled$sign_type[1:split]

next_sign <- signs_shuffled[206, 3:51]

```

```{r}

# Classify the next sign observed
signs_pred <- knn(train = train[-1], test = test[-1], cl = sign_types)

```

You have just trained your first nearest neighbor classifier!

## 1.2 - Thinking like kNN

With your help, the test car successfully identified the sign and stopped safely at the intersection.

How did the `knn()` function correctly classify the stop sign?

It was happened because the sign was in some way similar to another stop sign. In fact, kNN learning anytyhing! It simply looks for the most similar example.

## 1.3 - Exploring the traffic sign dataset

To better understand how the `knn()` function was able to classify the stop sign, it may help to examine the training dataset it used.

Each previously observed street sign was divided into a 4x4 grid, and the red, green, and blue level for each of the 16 center pixels is recorded as illustrated here.

```{r pressure1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/data_fintech_solutions/temp_1.png")
```

The result is a dataset that records the sign_type as well as 16 x 3 = 48 color properties of each sign.

```{r}
# Examine the structure of the signs dataset
str(signs)

# Count the number of signs of each type
table(signs$sign_type)

# Check r10's average red level by sign type
aggregate(r10 ~ sign_type, data = signs, mean)
```

As you might have expected, stop signs tend to have a higher average red value. This is how kNN identifies similar signs.

## 1.4 - Classifying a collection of road signs

Now that the autonomous vehicle has successfully stopped on its own, your team feels confident allowing the car to continue the test course.

The test course includes 59 additional road signs divided into three types:

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/data_fintech_solutions/temp_2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/data_fintech_solutions/temp_3.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/data_fintech_solutions/temp_4.png")
```

At the conclusion of the trial, you are asked to measure the car's overall performance at recognizing these signs.

So is the dataframe test_signs, which holds a set of observations you'll test your model on.

```{r}

# Create a confusion matrix of the predicted versus actual values
signs_actual <- test$sign_type
table(signs_actual, signs_pred)

# Compute the accuracy
mean(signs_actual == signs_pred)

```

That self-driving car is really coming along! The confusion matrix lets you look for patterns in the classifier's

## 1.5 - Understanding the impact of 'k'

There is a complex relationship between k and classification accuracy. Bigger is not always better.

Which of these is a valid reason for keeping k as small as possible (but no smaller)?

A smaller k may utilize more subtle patterns.


## 1.6 - Testing other 'k' values

By default, the `knn()` function in the class package uses only the single nearest neighbor.

Setting a k parameter allows the algorithm to consider additional nearby neighbors. This enlarges the collection of neighbors which will vote on the predicted class.

Compare k values of 1, 7, and 15 to examine the impact on traffic sign classification accuracy.

The class package is already loaded in your workspace along with the datasets signs, signs_test, and sign_types. The object signs_actual holds the true values of the signs.

```{r}

# Compute the accuracy of the baseline model (default k = 1)
k_1 <- knn(train = train[-1], test = test[-1], cl = sign_types)
mean(signs_actual == k_1)

# Modify the above to set k = 7
k_7 <- knn(train = train[-1], test = test[-1], cl = sign_types, k = 7)
mean(signs_actual == k_7)

# Set k = 15 and compare to the above
k_15 <- knn(train = train[-1], test = test[-1], cl = sign_types, k = 15)
mean(signs_actual == k_15)
```

## 1.7 - Seeing how the neighbors voted

When multiple nearest neighbors hold a vote, it can sometimes be useful to examine whether the voters were unanimous or widely separated.

For example, knowing more about the voters' confidence in the classification could allow an autonomous vehicle to use caution in the case there is any chance at all that a stop sign is ahead.

In this exercise, you will learn how to obtain the voting results from the knn() function.

```{r}

# Use the prob parameter to get the proportion of votes for the winning class
sign_pred <- knn(train = train[-1], test = test[-1], cl= sign_types, k = 7, prob = TRUE)

# Get the "prob" attribute from the predicted classes
sign_prob <- attr(sign_pred, "prob")

# Examine the first several predictions
head(sign_pred)

# Examine the proportion of votes for the winning class
head(sign_prob)

```

Wow! Awesome job! Now you can get an idea of how certain your kNN learner is about its classifications.

## 1.8 - Why normalize data?

Before applying kNN to a classification task, it is common practice to rescale the data using a technique like min-max normalization. What is the purpose of this step?

It is to ensure all data elements may contribute equal shares to distance. Rescaling reduces the influence of extreme values on kNN's distance function.

# Chapter 2 - Naive Bayes

The `where9am` data frame contains 91 days (thirteen weeks) worth of data in which Brett recorded his location at 9am each day as well as whether the daytype was a weekend or weekday.

Using the conditional probability formula below, you can compute the probability that Brett is working in the office, given that it is a weekday.

```{r}

where9am <- read.csv(file = "/data_fintech_solutions/locations.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

dim(where9am)

head(where9am)

str(where9am)

# Compute P(A) 
p_A <- nrow(subset(where9am, location == "office")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(B)
p_B <- nrow(subset(where9am, daytype == "weekday")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute the observed P(A and B)
p_AB <- nrow(subset(where9am, location == "office" & daytype == "weekday")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(A | B) and print its value
p_A_given_B <- p_AB / p_B
p_A_given_B

```

## 2.1 - Understanding dependent events

In the previous exercise, you found that there is a 26% chance Brett is in the office at 9am given that it is a weekday. 

The events do not overlap, knowing that one occurred tells you much about the status of the other.

## 2.2 - A simple Naive Bayes location model

The previous exercises showed that the probability that Brett is at work or at home at 9am is highly dependent on whether it is the weekend or a weekday.

To see this finding in action, use the `where9am` data frame to build a Naive Bayes model on the same data.

You can then use this model to predict the future: where does the model think that Brett will be at 9am on Thursday and at 9am on Saturday?

```{r}

thursday9am <- data.frame(weekday = "thursday", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

saturday9am <- data.frame(weekday = "saturday", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Load the naivebayes package
library(naivebayes)

# Build the location prediction model
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ weekday, data = where9am, laplace = 1)

# Predict Thursday's 9am location
predict(locmodel, thursday9am)

# Predict Saturdays's 9am location
predict(locmodel, saturday9am)


```

Awesome job! Not surprisingly, Brett is most likely at the office at 9am on a Thursday, but at home at the same time on a Saturday!

## 2.3 - Examining "raw" probabilities

The naivebayes package offers several ways to peek inside a Naive Bayes model.

Typing the name of the model object provides the a priori (overall) and conditional probabilities of each of the model's predictors. If one were so inclined, you might use these for calculating posterior (predicted) probabilities by hand.

Alternatively, R will compute the posterior probabilities for you if the type = "prob" parameter is supplied to the predict() function.

Using these methods, examine how the model's predicted 9am location probability varies from day-to-day. The model locmodel that you fit in the previous exercise is in your workspace.

```{r}

# Examine the location prediction model
print(locmodel)

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Thursday at 9am
predict(locmodel, thursday9am, type = "prob")

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Saturday at 9am
predict(locmodel, saturday9am, type = "prob")

```

Fantastic! Did you notice the predicted probability of Brett being at the office on a Saturday is almost zero?

## 2.4 - Understanding independence

Understanding the idea of event independence will become important as you learn more about how "naive" Bayes got its name. Which of the following is true about independent events?

Knowing the outcome of one event does not help predict the other. Yes! One event is independent of another if knowing one doesn't give you information about how likely the other is. For example, knowing if it's raining in New York doesn't help you predict the weather in San Francisco. The weather events in the two cities are independent of each other.

## 2.5 - Who are you calling naive?

The Naive Bayes algorithm got its name because it makes a "naive" assumption about event independence.

What is the purpose of making this assumption? The joint probability calculations is simpler for independent events. The joint probability of independent events can be computed much more simply by multiplying their individual probabilities

## 2.6 - A more sophisticated location model

The locations dataset (`where9am`) records Brett's location every hour for 13 weeks. Each hour, the tracking information includes the daytype (weekend or weekday) as well as the hourtype (morning, afternoon, evening, or night).

Using this data, build a more sophisticated model to see how Brett's predicted location not only varies by the day of week but also by the time of day.

You can specify additional independent variables in your formula using the + sign (e.g. y ~ x + b).

```{r}

weekday_afternoon <- data.frame(daytype = "weekday",
                                hourtype = "afternoon",
                                location = "office", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

weekday_evening <- data.frame(daytype = "weekday",
                                hourtype = "evening",
                                location = "home", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Build a NB model of location
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype + hourtype, where9am, laplace = 0)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday afternoon
predict(locmodel, weekday_afternoon)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday evening
predict(locmodel, weekday_evening)

```

Your Naive Bayes model forecasts that Brett will be at the office on a weekday afternoon and at home in the evening.

## 2.7 - Preparing for unforeseen circumstances

While Brett was tracking his location over 13 weeks, he never went into the office during the weekend. Consequently, the joint probability of P(office and weekend) = 0.

Explore how this impacts the predicted probability that Brett may go to work on the weekend in the future. Additionally, you can see how using the Laplace correction will allow a small chance for these types of unforeseen circumstances.

```{r}

weekend_afternoon <- data.frame(daytype = "weekend",
                                hourtype = "afternoon",
                                location = "home", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

weekend_evening <- data.frame(daytype = "weekend",
                                hourtype = "evening",
                                location = "home", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Observe the predicted probabilities for a weekend afternoon
predict(locmodel, weekend_afternoon, type = "prob")

# Build a new model using the Laplace correction
locmodel2 <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype + hourtype, where9am, laplace = 1)

# Observe the new predicted probabilities for a weekend afternoon
predict(locmodel2, weekend_afternoon, type = "prob")


```

Fantastic work! Adding the Laplace correction allows for the small chance that Brett might go to the office on the weekend in the future.

## 2.8 - Understanding the Laplace correction

By default, the `naive_bayes` function in the `naivebayes` packahe does not use the Laplace correction. What is the risk of leaving this parameter unset?

Some potential outcomes may be predicted to be impossible. The small probability added to every outcome ensures that they are all possible even if never previously observed.

# Chapter 3 - Logistic Regression

Logistic regression involves fitting a curve to numeric data to make predictions about binary events. Arguably one of the most widely used machine learning methods, this chapter will provide an overview of the technique while illustrating how to apply it to fundraising data.

## 3.1 - Building simple logistic regression models

The donors dataset contains 93,462 examples of people mailed in a fundraising solicitation for paralyzed military veterans. The donated column is 1 if the person made a donation in response to the mailing and 0 otherwise. This binary outcome will be the dependent variable for the logistic regression model.

The remaining columns are features of the prospective donors that may influence their donation behavior. These are the model's independent variables.

When building a regression model, it is often helpful to form a hypothesis about which independent variables will be predictive of the dependent variable. The bad_address column, which is set to 1 for an invalid mailing address and 0 otherwise, seems like it might reduce the chances of a donation. Similarly, one might suspect that religious interest (interest_religion) and interest in veterans affairs (interest_veterans) would be associated with greater charitable giving.

In this exercise, you will use these three factors to create a simple model of donation behavior. The dataset donors is available in your workspace.

```{r}

donors <- read.csv(file = "/data_fintech_solutions/donors.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Examine the dataset to identify potential independent variables
str(donors)

# Explore the dependent variable
table(donors$donated)

# Build the donation model
donation_model <- glm(donated ~ bad_address + interest_religion + interest_veterans, 
                      data = donors, family = "binomial")

# Summarize the model results
summary(donation_model)


```

Great work! With the model built, you can now use it to make predictions!
