<h2>1.1 - Recognizing a road sign with kNN</h2>
<p>After several trips with a human behind the wheel, it is time for the self-driving car to attempt the test course alone.</p>
<p>As it begins to drive away, its camera captures the following image:</p>

<p>There is a complex relationship between k and classification accuracy. Bigger is not always better.</p>

<p>A smaller k may utilize more subtle patterns.</p>

<h2>1.6 - Testing other ‘k’ values</h2>
<p>By default, the <code>knn()</code> function in the class package uses only the single nearest neighbor.</p>
<p>Setting a k parameter allows the algorithm to consider additional nearby neighbors. This enlarges the collection of neighbors which will vote on the predicted class.</p>
<p>Compare k values of 1, 7, and 15 to examine the impact on traffic sign classification accuracy.</p>
<p>The class package is already loaded in your workspace along with the datasets signs, signs_test, and sign_types. The object signs_actual holds the true values of the signs.</p>

<p>When multiple nearest neighbors hold a vote, it can sometimes be useful to examine whether the voters were unanimous or widely separated.</p>

<h2>1.8 - Why normalize data?</h2>
<p>Before applying kNN to a classification task, it is common practice to rescale the data using a technique like min-max normalization. What is the purpose of this step?</p>

<p>The naivebayes package offers several ways to peek inside a Naive Bayes model.</p>
<p>Typing the name of the model object provides the a priori (overall) and conditional probabilities of each of the model’s predictors. If one were so inclined, you might use these for calculating posterior (predicted) probabilities by hand.</p>
<p>Alternatively, R will compute the posterior probabilities for you if the type = “prob” parameter is supplied to the predict() function.</p>
<p>Using these methods, examine how the model’s predicted 9am location probability varies from day-to-day. The model locmodel that you fit in the previous exercise is in your workspace.</p>

<h2>2.4 - Understanding independence</h2>
<p>Understanding the idea of event independence will become important as you learn more about how “naive” Bayes got its name. Which of the following is true about independent events?</p>
<p>Knowing the outcome of one event does not help predict the other. Yes! One event is independent of another if knowing one doesn’t give you information about how likely the other is. For example, knowing if it’s raining in New York doesn’t help you predict the weather in San Francisco. The weather events in the two cities are independent of each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-are-you-calling-naive" class="section level2">
<h2>2.5 - Who are you calling naive?</h2>
<p>The Naive Bayes algorithm got its name because it makes a “naive” assumption about event independence.</p>

<h1>Chapter 3 - Logistic Regression</h1>
<p>Logistic regression involves fitting a curve to numeric data to make predictions about binary events. Arguably one of the most widely used machine learning methods, this chapter will provide an overview of the technique while illustrating how to apply it to fundraising data.</p>
<div id="building-simple-logistic-regression-models" class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 - Building simple logistic regression models</h2>
<p>The donors dataset contains 93,462 examples of people mailed in a fundraising solicitation for paralyzed military veterans. The donated column is 1 if the person made a donation in response to the mailing and 0 otherwise. This binary outcome will be the dependent variable for the logistic regression model.</p>
<p>The remaining columns are features of the prospective donors that may influence their donation behavior. These are the model’s independent variables.</p>
<p>When building a regression model, it is often helpful to form a hypothesis about which independent variables will be predictive of the dependent variable. The bad_address column, which is set to 1 for an invalid mailing address and 0 otherwise, seems like it might reduce the chances of a donation. Similarly, one might suspect that religious interest (interest_religion) and interest in veterans affairs (interest_veterans) would be associated with greater charitable giving.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will use these three factors to create a simple model of donation behavior. The dataset donors is available in your workspace.</p>

<h2>3.2 - Making a binary prediction</h2>
<p>In the previous exercise, you used the glm() function to build a logistic regression model of donor behavior. As with many of R’s machine learning methods, you can apply the predict() function to the model object to forecast future behavior. By default, predict() outputs predictions in terms of log odds unless type = “response” is specified. This converts the log odds to probabilities.</p>
<p>Because a logistic regression model estimates the probability of the outcome, it is up to you to determine the threshold at which the probability implies action. One must balance the extremes of being too cautious versus being too aggressive. For example, if you were to solicit only the people with a 99% or greater donation probability, you may miss out on many people with lower estimated probabilities that still choose to donate. This balance is particularly important to consider for severely imbalanced outcomes, such as in this dataset where donations are relatively rare.</p>

<h2>3.8 - Understanding missing value indicators</h2>
<p>A missing value indicator provides a reminder that, before imputation, there was a missing value present on the record.</p>
<p>Why is it often useful to include this indicator as a predictor in the model? It is useful for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A missing value may represent a unique category by itself</li>
<li>There may be an important difference between records with and without missing data</li>
<li>Whatever caused the missing value may also be related to the outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a missing value says a great deal about the record it appeared on!</p>

<h2>3.9 - Building a more sophisticated model</h2>
<p>One of the best predictors of future giving is a history of recent, frequent, and large gifts. In marketing terms, this is known as R/F/M:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recency</li>
<li>Frequency</li>
<li>Money</li>
</ul>
<p>Donors that haven’t given both recently and frequently may be especially likely to give again; in other words, the combined impact of recency and frequency may be greater than the sum of the separate effects.</p>
<p>Because these predictors together have a greater impact on the dependent variable, their joint effect must be modeled as an interaction.</p>

<h2>3.10 - The dangers of stepwise regression</h2>
<p>In spite of its utility for feature selection, stepwise regression is not frequently used in disciplines outside of machine learning due to some important caveats.
